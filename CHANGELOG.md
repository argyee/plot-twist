## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-29

  - Moved all source code to `src/` directory
  - Moved database files to `data/` directory (excluded from git)
  - Split `bot.js` into modular architecture
  - **New folder structure**:

      - `database.js` - SQLite database operations
      - `tmdb.js` - TMDB API integration
    - `src/messages/` - Language files with loader
- Updated all import paths to reflect new structure

- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `data/` folder and `.DS_Store` files
